# Machine Learning in Python 

Welcome to our Machine Learning Labs repository. This collection includes a series of collaborative labs completed as part of our coursework, each designed to explore foundational and advanced topics in machine learning. These hands-on projects demonstrate our ability to apply theoretical concepts using real data across domains like tabular data, image data, and neural networks.

Each lab highlights a different aspect of the machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, model building, evaluation, and deep learning architectures.

Labs Included:

Lab 1: Exploring Tabular Data

Lab 2: Exploring Image Data

Lab 3: Extending Logistic Regression

Lab 4: Multi-Layer Perceptron

Lab 5: Wide and Deep Networks

Lab 6: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Lab 7: Sequential Networks

Team Members:

- Nino Castellano
