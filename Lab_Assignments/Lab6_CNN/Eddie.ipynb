    "We are building a machine learning model based on a dataset of One Piece amine characters. Essentially, we will be building a Chat-GBT-like system, however, instead of being text-based. Our system will accept images. From that data, the software will accurately predict the name of the One Piece character. Originally we will build this software on a smaller dataset, once the algorithm is mastered to our liking, we will introduce an entire dataset with the remaining characters and additional pictures. We believe there is tremendous financial opportunity. This software will act as the backbone of our company's growth. Initially, we will sell our products to booths at Comic-Con where individuals will walk up and the machine will predict what character they are dressed up as. In the future, we will expand to many different anime shows and characters. We anticipate that our software will not only cater to the cosplay community but also attract interest from anime enthusiasts worldwide. Additionally, as our system evolves, we envision incorporating real-time updates and collaborations with cosplay communities to enhance accuracy and inclusivity."
