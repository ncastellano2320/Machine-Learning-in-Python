    "\n",
    "Final Dataset Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean of each numeric column (except 'Volume') is approximately 0, indicating that the data has been centered around zero.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (std): The standard deviation of each numeric column is approximately 1, indicating that the data has been scaled to have unit variance.\n",
    "Min/Max: The minimum and maximum values of each column vary, but after scaling, they're within a comparable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of Scaling: By scaling the data, we've transformed the features such that they have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This ensures that the features are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of certain algorithms, such as logistic regression.\n",
    "Scaling helps in preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the optimization process and ensures that the model learns the underlying patterns more effectively.\n",
    "For instance, without scaling, the 'Volume' column, which has much larger values compared to the price columns, could disproportionately influence the model's predictions. Scaling mitigates this issue by putting all features on a comparable scale.\n",
    "In summary, scaling the data ensures that the logistic regression model can effectively learn from all features without being biased by differences in feature magnitudes. It helps in improving model convergence and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle Missing Values: Impute missing values with the mean of each numeric column, ensuring that the dataset is complete for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets: Define features (X) and the target variable (y), then split the data into training and testing sets. Here, you can choose a relevant column as the target variable. Since we are dealing with stock price prediction, you might want to predict the future close price based on historical data. Therefore, you should keep the 'Close' column as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretize the Target Variable y: Since you want to predict whether to buy, sell, or hold stocks based on price movements, you need to discretize the 'Close' column into multiple classes. You can do this by categorizing the price movements into different categories (e.g., if the price increases, decreases, or remains the same). The number of bins will depend on how finely you want to categorize the price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Unique Values: After splitting the data and discretizing the target variable, it's essential to verify the unique values in both y_test (the actual target values in the testing set) and predictions (the predicted values). This check helps ensure that the model outputs and actual targets align properly and allows for further analysis of the classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the 'Close' column already exists in your dataset, and you'll use it as the target variable for predicting future price movements. Then, you'll discretize this column into multiple classes representing different price movements (e.g., buy, sell, hold) to perform classification."

    "We chose an 80/20 split for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing Training and Testing Data: An 80/20 split is a common choice that strikes a balance between having enough data for training the model effectively and having a sufficient amount of data for evaluating its performance. With 80% of the data allocated for training, the model can learn from a substantial portion of the dataset, while the 20% testing set provides a reasonable amount of data for evaluating the model's generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-off between Bias and Variance: A larger training set (e.g., 80%) can help reduce bias by providing more data for the model to learn from, potentially leading to a more accurate model. However, a smaller testing set (e.g., 20%) can increase the variance of performance estimates, as there is less data available for evaluation. Nonetheless, in practice, an 80/20 split is often sufficient for obtaining reliable performance estimates while ensuring efficient use of data for training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Efficiency: Using a smaller testing set can lead to faster model evaluation, which is advantageous when experimenting with different models or hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the 80/20 split is a widely used and practical choice for dividing data into training and testing sets, offering a good balance between model training and evaluation requirements. If you have specific considerations or requirements that suggest a different split ratio, feel free to adjust it accordingly."

    "### 2) Modeling \n",
    "#### 2.1) Creating a Muilti-Class Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "For creating a multi-classifier we must first create a seperate Binary Classifier for each unique class. We are tasked with creating a **One-Versus-All (OvA)** classifier where the samples belonging to the class being considered are treated as positive examples, while samples from other classes are treated as negative, for each seperate Binary Classifier trained. During the prediction stages we will run an instance through each Binary Classifier, choosing the one that has the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code defines a Binary Logistic Regression class that will be used to train and evaluate a multi-class classifier. It is derived from the *BinaryLogisticRegressionBase* class in eclarson's notebook *Logistic Regression.ipynb* and from the *BinaryLogisticRegression* class in his *Optimization.ipynb*. This includes a customizable regularization term C for when adjusted, affects the regularization term by regulating the trade-off between fitting the training data and keeping the model's weights small. A **higher value of C** implies less regularization, allowing the model to fit the training data more closely, potentially leading to overfitting. Conversely, a **lower value of C** increases the regularization strength, encouraging the model to generalize better to unseen data by keeping the weights smaller.  We are calculating gradient using a lower C value which is closer to **L2 reguralization** primarly to improve generalization by penalizing large coefficients, which in turn encourages the model to learn simpler patterns in the data. This is particularly important to our finacial prediction tasks, where the goal is often to generalize well to new market conditions."

    "Comparing the scikit-learn model to our implementations are pretty much night and day. The scikit-learn model produced a slightly higher accuracy of **0.9708** compared to the Newton's method, which produced an accuracy of **0.9684**. However, the time difference is what really made the scikit-learn model more superior to our best model, as it classified our training and testing data in a CPU time of just **55.3 ms**, compared to **1.26 s**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This time difference can be explained due paralellization, which is handled much better through scikit-learn as the operations are all performed in lower level C++. The accuracy can also be explained because the lr_sk object we created uses regularization, which controls over-learning. This optimization allows scikit-learn to process our data in much finer steps. "

    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn model essentially compacts all of our previous logistic regression code and packages it in a library that can be utilized in just four lines of code. Scikit-learn's logistic regression implementation is optimized for processing datasets of various sizes. Even with our current dataset of 1645 training records and 412 testing records, scikit-learn's efficient processing ensures fast model training and prediction. Additionally, should our dataset grow larger in the future, scikit-learn's scalability ensures constant performance without compromising speed, like our custom models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn's widespread adoption into many different languages ensures access to further documentation should anything break in the future. With our custom implementation, detecting an error can be pearlous and can cost future developers or people maintaining our model a lot of time. "
