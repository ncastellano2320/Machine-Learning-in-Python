    "The dataset we chose pertains to mushrooms, specifically whether or not they are poisonous, and is called *mushrooms.csv*. We obtained this data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification). The results of our model could benefit food production companies, farmers, or people who enjoy the outdoors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this dataset becasue every feature column is a categorical variable, which makes this perfect for a wide and deep neural network. This data set contains descriptions of samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms found in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom. Each species will be identified to be either definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or unknown edibility. "

    "> [1 points] Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). You have the option of using tf.dataset for processing, but it is not required. "
